Variables in programming are the same as variables in math
Only instead of limiting you to numbers, variables can be any type
=====
This can include numbers like these

my_first_variable = 42
pi = 3.14
bank_balance = -80.00
=====
Variables can also be strings, for example

the_question = "To be or not to be"
space = "The final frontier"
empty_string = ""
=====
Variables can be a boolean, this means they have only two possible states
True or False

are_you_reading_this = True
are_you_the_president = False
